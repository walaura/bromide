# bromide-differ

Generates a diff in the format `bromide` expects.

```
npx bromide-differ -i screenshots -o out
```

your `screenshots` directory must contain 2 directories, `change` and `original`, and they must contain images named equally that will be compared against each other (have a look at the `example` folder)
